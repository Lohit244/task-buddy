              <p> Your Team has a Task to do. </p>
              <p> You split the task among yourselves. </p>
              <p> You realise you want some part of the task from the other members to be completed to make progress on your part. </p>
              <p className="font-semibold">
                At this point you wish for some mechanism to track the progress of the other team member.
              </p>
              <p>
                But because a simple solution didn&apos;t exist one member ends up taking up a significant part of the task for both of the team members.

              <p> Your team at work has been assigned a task with multiple components. You all decide to split the work among yourselves to ensure efficient completion. However, as you dive into your respective parts, you soon realize that one team member is struggling to complete their assigned work and has requested help. </p>
              <p> Due to the lack of a streamlined tracking mechanism, it becomes challenging to gauge the progress made by the struggling team member. As a result, another team member, recognizing the urgency and importance of the task, ends up taking on a significant portion of the work to compensate for their colleague&apos;s difficulties. </p>
              <p> You realise you want some part of the task from the other members to be completed to make progress on your part. </p>
              <p>
                This increased workload on one team member not only impacts their productivity but also affects the overall balance of the team&apos;s responsibilities. It becomes apparent that without a clear means of monitoring progress and addressing issues promptly, tasks may become disproportionately distributed among team members, leading to inefficiencies and potential burnout.
